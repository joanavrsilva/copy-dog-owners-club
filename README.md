# Dog Owners Club 
Dog Owners Club is a fictional website where Dublin's dog owners can find activities for them and their pets.
The site also features an image gallery and a "Contact" page as well as links to the organization's social media platforms.

This project consists of a copy of the project I created, [Dog Owners Club](https://joanavrsilva.github.io/dog-owners-club/), for submission during the Code Institute course.

In this repository I will make some changes that I want to add later to the original project.
